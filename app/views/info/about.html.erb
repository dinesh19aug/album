                        It would not be wrong to say that photography is in my blood. I come from a family where my grandfather was a renowned cinmatographer in Marathi film industry.My uncle followed his footstep and joined the film industry as cinmatographer, while my own father and brother are in Still photography.

                        It was in 2008 I got an opportunity to move to Charlotte,North Carolina US from San Francisco. This journey from the hip city, SF to Queen city, Charlotte came with a new blessing and I started as an amateur photographer doing photoshoot for friends and their families, the kaleidoscope within me started finding a new expression.

                        After many years as a keen amateur photographer, I decided to start a small  photography business. I realized that I enjoy working with kids and babies. It quickly became apparent that I was enjoying my part time job much more than I had anticipated and I decided that this was where my future lay. I decided to become a full time professional photographer.
